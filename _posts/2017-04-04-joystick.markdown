I had always wanted a joystick, and since I had access to a 3D printer, I decided to design one using Fusion 360. I didn't find much information on how joysticks are designed aside from a few blog posts by people who had built their own. I went with a ball joint design and potentiometers mounted to measure the change in angle.

I quickly made a prototype to visualize the idea. There were problems with the first version. The ball joint, being made from 3D printed PLA plastic, wasn't smooth enough. The mounting I made for the potentiometers ended up being too large and unstable.

I'm currently working on making the whole assembly smaller, as well as eliminating the ball joint. I was hoping to implement a centering mechanism as well.
