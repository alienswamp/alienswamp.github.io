I was approached by the owner of NY Bagel Cafe in Los Angeles to make a CAD model of his storefront. The owner was looking to have an awning put in
to better utilize the outside area. I modelled the cafe and surrounding stores to provide context from reference images. The awning design was
modelled after the next door sushi restaurant's planned awning. The end result was used by the owner of NY Bagel as a visual aid for a presentation
to the property owner and awning company.
