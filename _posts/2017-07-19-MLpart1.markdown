I have been learning about mobile robotics for a while as part of my larger research project. The plan for the summer is to implement a better method of map merging for multi-robot SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). My friend, in an internship related to machine learning, told me about how machine learning can be used to identify certain features in images. One of the examples that he used was the MNIST data set. Using machine learning algorithms, a computer can identify handwritten numbers with incredible accuracy. I aimed to use the same concept to identify "important features" in maps generated by robots and then match the maps to create a single merged map.

Recently I have been working with various image detection algorithms and am planning to apply the ML algorithms to architectural plans, as a test. Once that works reasonably well, I would like to move on to actual multi robot LIDAR data.
