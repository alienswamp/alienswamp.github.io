While looking up mechanism construction on Youtube, I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/AXtKHnHlt0c"> this video</a>, which inspired me to build some mechanisms of my own. Unfortunately I'm currently unable to 3D print the Geneva Mechanism I made, but I was able to model it in Fusion 360.

I decided not to work off of the templates available online, instead I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feA4ZfnTrSc"> a video</a> showing the geometry behind the construction of the Geneva Mechanism. I used formulas available online to properly dimension my model.
