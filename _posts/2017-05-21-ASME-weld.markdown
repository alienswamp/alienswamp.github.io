I joined ASME club in Stony Brook at the beginning of my Sophomore Spring semester. I had been interested in learning to weld, so when I heard that the club's go kart build needed a welder, I jumped at the opportunity. I had very little prior experience with welding but by the end I had put in about 30 hours of welding time, and learned a whole lot more about metal fabrication.

One of the team members designed the frame in Autodesk Inventor. I had some input into the design, since I noticed a weak point while welding. Unfortunately the length of the steel tubes we used was rather short, so the frame had a joint where the driver would be sitting. To solve this, I welded together reinforcements in a few places to ensure safety.

We used steel square tubing to form the body. Since the FSAE club I was in used TIG, I figured it'd be better to learn TIG welding so I could help out in FSAE as a welder.

The frame is currently finished. Our next steps will be installing the eletronics. I'll personally be fitting the motors and ESCs.
